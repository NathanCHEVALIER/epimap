# September 2023 (v.2023-9.1) Release

## Welcome Epimap v2 !

It's back to school time for Epimap, with a new version! Data is now integrated into the maps, enabling advanced searches (by person, by keyword...). We've also taken the opportunity to rework the UI.

### New Features:

- Search system: You can search efficiently for a room, a type of room or the name of a person. Search results take you straight to the right map.

- Room information: Clicking on a room displays some information about it, including the people assigned to it.

## Maps update:

The following maps have been updated:

- Kremlin-Bicêtre Voltaire Groundfloor to 6th floor
- Kremlin-Bicêtre Paritalie 1st floor.

## Fixes:

- Fix the use of direct links to maps on smartphones
- Replace XhttpRequest

## Issues:

Opened issues: #44, #45, #49

Closed issues:  #6 #30 #36 #40 #41
