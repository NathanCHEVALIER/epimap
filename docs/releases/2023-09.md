# September 2023 (v.2023-9.1) Release

## Welcome Epimap v2 !

It's back to school time for Epimap, with a new version!
We have integrated references in the maps, linked to json data, enabling advanced searches (by person, by keyword...) and complete room informations on UI. We've also taken the opportunity to rework the UI.
