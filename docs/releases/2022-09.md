## New Features:

- Add logger for warnings, errors and infos in a notification UI module: A colourful box could appear at bottom-right corner to inform user about maps loading error, deprecation or others informations

- Color mode preference persistent: your personnal color mode (dark or light mode) is now saved in a cookie and restored from during your next session. In order to respect your privacy, this cookie is only on your browser and any data is sent to any server or service, so it is RGPD compliant.

## Fixes:

- Fix navigation with History API: Set updated path as a new entry in browser history and not as an update of previous entry in order to enable History navigation. Thanks to @Matiboux for this contribution.

- Fix settings menu UI: Settings menu (accessible with 3 points at the right hand of headre) have a new layout. UI elements are also updated. In addition, darkmode is now applied in this menu.

## Privacy Improvment

What a news! Google APIs are no more called on Epimap, which means you are now ANY tracker on Epimap. The last one was dued to Google Font API, recently replaced by self-host font files.
